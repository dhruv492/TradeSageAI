Modification History:
    2026-08-07 - Recreated (rebuild session). Implements FR-3.3-3.5 as the
                 orchestration layer over signal_engine.py (baseline),
                 lstm_model.py, feature_pipeline.py, sentiment_service.py,
                 and explainability_service.py.
Synopsis:
    Ties the full Signal Engine together: builds the feature set for an
    asset (technical + sentiment), runs the RandomForest baseline and LSTM
    on the same features, and persists one Signal row per model (FR-3.3's
    "shown side by side" requirement -> two rows, not one row with two
    columns, so the dashboard's feedback loop in FR-6.2 can compare either
    model's history against actual outcomes independently).

    Each Signal row's topContributingFeatures is populated via
    explainability_service.getTopContributingFeatures (SHAP), replacing the
    earlier permutation-importance placeholder.

Functions:
    generateSignal(dbSession, userId, assetSymbol, assetType, priceDf,
                    sentimentScore, rfModel, rfBackground, lstmModel,
                    lstmBackground, featureNames, horizonDays)
        -> list[Signal]  (two persisted rows: baseline + LSTM)

        priceDf must already cover enough history to build both the
        instantaneous feature row (for RF) and the last windowSize rows
        (for LSTM) — building that history is the caller's/app.py's job,
        not this module's, to keep this module free of I/O concerns beyond
        the DB session it's given.

Globals accessed/modified: None.
